                Our Clinic recognizes the relationship between the physical,
                emotional and psychological aspects of a patient’s health. Our
                philosophy is to offer a holistic approach to care, attempting
                to address each of these factors. To that end, our mental health
                providers closely collaborate with our medical providers to
                offer a range of services that support patients’ emotional and
                psychological well-being. These services are affirmative,
                sex-positive, respectful and culturally sensitive.
