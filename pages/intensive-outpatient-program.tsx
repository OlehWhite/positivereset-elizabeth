            <Text>
              When individuals are in need of a structured setting in which to
              work towards overcoming symptoms of mental health, behavioral
              health, and/or substance abuse concerns, they may find benefits
              from engaging in an intensive outpatient program (IOP). This
              treatment option allows individuals to receive thorough treatment
              that fully addresses their needs in a less restrictive environment
              than that which is offered in partial hospitalization programming
              (PHP), inpatient treatment, or residential care. Yet, it provides
              a more structured therapeutic setting than that which is typically
              offered in a traditional outpatient setting.

          Prior to engaging in any form on treatment, individuals must first
          partake in a thorough psychosocial assessment. During these
          assessments, an individual’s history is reviewed, including presenting
          symptoms and the way in which those symptoms have impacted his or her
          ability to function on a daily basis. Additionally, one’s physical and
          psychological background will be reviewed in order to obtain further
          pertinent information. Once this assessment is complete, it will be
          reviewed by clinical staff who will then determine what the most
          appropriate level of care will be in order for the individual’s needs
          to be met. If it is determined that an intensive outpatient program
          (IOP) will be of the most benefit to the individual in need of care,
          the admissions process will commence.

          The structure of outpatient programs can vary from one treatment
          center to the next in regards of how many days per week the sessions
          are offered, the amount of hours per day that the program takes place,
          and the length of time during which the program lasts. When
          individuals enter into IOP, they will be made aware of the specific
          times that the program meets so that they can determine which
          schedules work best for them without hindering their ability to adhere
          to other daily responsibilities.

          All individuals who engage in IOP receive individualized treatment
          plans that are tailored to meet their unique needs so that their
          treatment goals can be most appropriately met. These individualized
          treatment plans will include a variety of therapeutic interventions,
          which may include the following: Medication management:In some
          instances, the implementation of psychotropic medications can benefit
          certain individuals as a complement to therapeutic interventions, as
          they can work to alleviate the physical and psychological distress
          that certain symptoms elicit. All medications are prescribed by a
          licensed psychiatrist, and follow-up meetings with the psychiatrist
          will be held on an as-needed basis.
